1)Boolean data type has only two values: True and False,
a=True
b=False
First letter of True and false will be capital

2) three types of boolean operators:

The AND operator (&& or "and")
The OR operator (|| or "or")
The NOT operator (not)

3)Truth table of or operator:
A   B   A or B
0   0      0
0   1      1
1   0      1
1   1      1

Truth Table of AND Operator

A    B    A  AND B
0    0        0
0    1        0
1    0        0
1    1        1

Truth Table of not Operator

A   NOT A
1    0
0    1


4)5 > 4) and (3 == 5) output: False
not (5 >4)output: False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)output: True
(True and True) and (True == False) output: False
(not False) or (not True) output: True

5)==	    Equal	      x == y	
  !=	    Not equal	  x != y	
  >       Greater than	x > y	
  <	      Less than	    x < y	
  >=	    Greater than or equal to	 x >= y	
  <=	    Less than or equal to      x<=y
  
  
  
6)equalto operator when we use double equale sign like ==, it is basically a comparision operator ,like 5==6 it checks that 5 is equal to 6 or not

but = is an assignment operator , this is basically use to store value inside a variable like a=5;



7)spam = 0
if spam == 10:
   print("eggs")
if spam > 5:
   print("bacon")
else:
   print("ham")
   print("spam")
   print("spam")
   
here print("eggs") is one block of code

next print("bacon") is another block of code
next else part is another block of code


8) if spam ==1:
      print("Hello")
   if spam == 2:
      print("Howdy")
   else:
      print("Greetings")
      
9)we  have to break the endless loop, which can be done by pressing Ctrl+C

10)i)break eliminates the execution of remaining iteration of loop,continue will terminate only the current iteration of loop
ii)The ‘break ‘stop the continuation of the loop. but The ‘continue’ does not stop the continuation of loop and it stops the current.

iii)break is early termination of loop but continue is the early execution of the next iteration


11) in a for loop range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) represent the same things 
 range(10) here in this case start of range is bydefault 0 and ending is 10 and step is bydefault 1
  
  range(0,10) here starting is 0 ending is 10 but step is not given
  
  range(0,10,1) here starting is 0 ending is 10 step is 1 so all three sre same
  
12)
using for loop:-
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

using while loop:-
i=0
while i<10:
   print(i)
   i=i+1
   
13)import spam
   spam.bacon()
